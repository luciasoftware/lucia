# Something broke

Lucia is currently untested at large. Thus, we expect many bugs to crop up.
In order to help us help you, try and provide as much information as possible so we can get to the bottom of the issue.
The following is a list of questions that should be addressed in each issue labeled as a bugfix. Exclude as applicable.

* What were you trying to do?
* what happened?
* What did you expect to happen?
* Are you using the most up-to-date version of Lucia?
* What version of windows are you running?
* Do you have any idea what may be causing the problem and/or how it might be fixed?
* Anything else you think may assist us in addressing/solving the problem
